I have created a Quiz application, using JavaScript and Materialized. 

When taking this quiz you will be prompted for questions. If you get one wrong you will loose 15 seconds and 10 points. If you get a question right you earn 25 points.

When the timer reaches 0 you are presented with the GAME OVER screen. You then enter your initals for the Score Board.
